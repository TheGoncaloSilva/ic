Repository for Information and Codification (Informação e Codificação) university course. This course primarily provides knowledge and skills in the area of data compression. It begins by introducing/reviewing signal processing concepts (*sampling*, *quantization*, *frequency domain representation*) and information theory, as well as the notion of redundancy (*perceptual and statistical/algorithmic*). Compression algorithms and their application to various sources (text, audio, image, video) are then presented, complemented by a brief overview of major audio, image, and video coding standards. The course also aims to provide a unified view of concepts relating aspects of computer theory (*Turing machines*, *computability*) to aspects of classical information theory (*entropy*, *source coding*, *data compression models*), concepts of randomness and predictability, and their application to data analysis and exploration. By the end of this course unit, students should know and understand:

1. The fundamentals of information theory and signal processing involved in efficient information representation.
2. The fundamentals and necessity of using data compression algorithms.
3. The operation of major data compression algorithms.
4. The relationship between data compression, the notion of algorithmic entropy, and data analysis and exploration.

Achieved final grade of 17 out of 20.
